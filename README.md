# Image-measurements
The aim of this practical project was to plan, implement and document an imagebased measurement. The system should be able to estimate correctly the number of coins
in the image. It has been given in advance that the measuring device, the measuringobject, and the purpose of the measurement remain the same. More specifically, the
purpose is to correct the pre-given images by using calibration information.
